## Panda CMS is the CMS we always wanted. üêº

Better websites, on Rails.

[Read more about the project...](https://github.com/pandacms/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) ‚ú®

Panda is grown from our work at [Otaina](https://www.otaina.co.uk), a small group of freelancers. We needed something that could handle websites large and small ‚Äì but where we could expand it too. We sent our first websites live in March 2024.

## Usage

To create a new Rails app[^1], run the command below, replacing `demo` with the name of the application you want to create:

```
rails new demo $(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandacms/generator/main/.railsrc) -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandacms/generator/main/template.rb
```

`cd` into your directory (e.g. `demo`) and run `bin/dev`. You'll see a basic website has automatically been created for you at http://localhost:3000/

The easiest way for you to get started is to visit http://localhost:3000/admin and login with your GitHub credentials. As the first user, you'll automatically have an administrator account created.

### Existing applications

Add the following to `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.pkg.github.com/pandacms" do
  gem "panda_cms"
end
```

For initial setup, run:

```shell
bundle install
rails generate panda_cms:install
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

If you don't want to use GitHub to login, you'll need to configure a user provider (in `config/initializers/panda_cms.rb`), and then set your user's `admin` attribute to `true` once you've first tried to login. (And yes, there should be a better first-time setup experience than this. We're working on it!)

## Gotchas

This is a non-exhuastive list (there will be many more):

* To date, this has only been tested with Rails 7.1 and 7.2.
* This assumes you're using Tailwind CSS for your frontend. We'll attempt to relax this in future, but supporting Tailwind CSS is our current priority.
* If you change your login path from `/admin` the GitHub application we supply won't work on first login, so probably don't do that until you're setup!
