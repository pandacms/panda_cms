Except for the licenses granted herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Contribution.

You confirm that you are able to grant us these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license.

## Developing

Run the following command and ensure your Gemfile is setup as follows:

```
bundle config set panda.cms.local PATH_TO_PANDA_CMS_DIRECTORY
```

```ruby
gem "panda_cms", github: "pandacms/panda_cms", branch: "main"
```

Alternatively, you may want to use a path to a folder on disk in the `Gemfile` itself:

```ruby
gem "panda_cms", path: "../panda_cms"
```

## Assets

Whilst developing, you'll likely want to run the task `rake panda_cms:assets:watch_admin` to ensure your assets are updated. Alternatively, you can run `rake panda_cms:assets:compile`.

## Branching

When creating new branches, please use the following format: `prefix/name-of-branch`. Prefixes we use are:

* `bugfix` - fixes to bugs
* `feature` - new features or functionality
* `hotfix` - quick fixes, such as text or UI changes, that aren't part of a larger bugfix
* `docs` - documentation improvements (that aren't part of another update)
* `config` - configuration changes
* `dep` – dependency updates, e.g. gem updates or similar
* `release` - a new release of the gem
* `ux` - frontend changes that do not fit into the categories above
* `devex` - developer experience (e.g. IDEs, scripts, etc.)

If available, include the ID of the Github issue in the branch, e.g. `bugfix/123-correct-timezones-on-page-edit`

Here's an example of a PR which follows these guidelines: https://github.com/pandacms/panda_cms/pull/5

## Lefthook

We use [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) for running pre-commit hooks. You can install this using:

```bash
lefthook install -f
```

## Tests

To setup tests, from the `panda_cms/spec/dummy` directory, run:

```bash
RAILS_ENV=test rails db:create
RAILS_ENV=test rails db:schema:load
```

Then, for test runs, from the `panda_cms` directory, run:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

System tests are run using `rack_test`, or for JavaScript, `cuprite`. This will run Chrome headlessly (without the browser window visible), and save failure screenshots to `spec/dummy/tmp/capybara`. If you want to see the browser (using the `cuprite` driver), prefix your commands with `HEADLESS=0`, such as:

```bash
HEADLESS=0 bundle exec rspec spec/system/website_spec.rb
```

You can also use the `pause` command within a test to pause browser execution. Resume by returning to your console and pressing the enter key.

## Using the dummy application

Panda CMS includes a dummy application we use to test the functionality of the CMS is available and working. This is using RSpec (so lives in `spec/dummy` rather than the traditional `test/dummy`).

In future, we may need different versions of dummy applications to test different asset pipelines or versions of Rails.

<mark>We haven't yet added instructions on how to set up your authentication provider; you may have some luck signing in with GitHub in the meantime. If you're using the default configuration, try login for the first time then set your user to be `admin = true`. We'll sort some better setup steps soon. 🙂</mark>

This runs a Rails server, and watch tasks for both the engine's CSS and dummy application's CSS.
