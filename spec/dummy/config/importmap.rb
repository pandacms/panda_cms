# The idea is this file needs nothing explicitly pinned from panda-cms,
# that should all get handled by the engine.rb, etc.

# This just checks that Stimulus can be included without conflicting
pin "@hotwired/stimulus", to: "@hotwired--stimulus.js" # @3.2.2

# This just checks that a normal JS file and Stimulus controllers folder can be included
pin_all_from "app/javascript/controllers", under: "controllers"
